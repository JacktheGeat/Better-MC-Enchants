# Enchantments, Advancements, and Tweaks
Have you ever noticed how tridents can't get sharpness, or crossbows can't get infinity? Thats really stupid. Crossbows still can't get infinity using this datapack, but arrows can explode, so I think its close enough.
In this datapack I am looking to fix some of the newer tools added to the game, like tridents being more easily acquirable, and actually being repairable. But also add more depth to them as well. 
Tridents and crossbows get unique enchantments highlighting their strengths, and new endgame enchantments are added as findable loot in dungeons, end cities, and bastions.
